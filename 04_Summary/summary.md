# AI-Challenge 2023 @ ost

## Autonomous Driving Model Learning

### Goals and Expectations
- **26 Students** with diverse backgrounds
- **9 Teams**, **8 Coaches**, **2 External Presenters**
- **Framework Conditions**: Basic IT Knowledge, Linux Experience, Python Basics, Prior Contact with AI
- **Meetings**: 3 On-Site (Kick Off, Checkpoint, Final Challenge)

### Participants
- Expected Prior Knowledge
- Challenge Attendance

### Goals
- Detecting a Stop Sign with labeled Data (Detection rate of at least 65%)
- Follow a Guided Path marked by Blue Tape
- Cross Multiple Paths
- Combine all to Autonomously Drive the Car in a Complete Environment

### Training the Model
1. **Collect Data**
2. **Prepare Data**
3. **Define & Train Model**
4. **Optimize the Model**
5. **Use the Model**

### Conditions for Model Training
- Good Lightning
- Constant Speed
- Following the Blue Line

### Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
- **Convolutional Layers**: Detect features like edges, textures, shapes
- **Pooling Layers**: Reduce spatial dimensions, focus on important information
- **Fully Connected Layers**: Connect neurons for final classification/output

### Model Lifecycle
1. **Gathering Data**: Identify and integrate various data sources
2. **Data Preparation**: Exploration, pre-processing
3. **Validating the Model**: Testing, examining construction
4. **Deployment**: Optimization, using the model
